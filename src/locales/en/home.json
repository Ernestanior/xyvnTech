      },
      {
        "question": "How are project costs calculated?",
        "answer": "We offer two payment models: [One-time Purchase] Pay full development cost upfront, project fully owned by you, suitable for clients with sufficient budget who need complete control; [Subscription] Pay lower initial fee, subscribe monthly/yearly including cloud hosting, maintenance updates, technical support, etc., 20-30% lower total cost over 3 years, suitable for clients wanting lower upfront investment and continuous service. See pricing page or contact us for detailed quotes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between subscription and one-time purchase?",
        "answer": "[One-time Purchase]: Pay full cost once (e.g., corporate website NT$80,000-250,000), source code and ownership are yours, future maintenance requires separate payment. [Subscription]: Pay lower initial setup fee (e.g., NT$8,000-25,000) + monthly fee (NT$1,299-3,999/month), includes cloud hosting, SSL certificate, CDN acceleration, daily backups, technical support, feature updates, etc., lower total cost over 3 years, no worries about servers and maintenance. Subscription is more suitable for most SMEs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the subscription service include?",
        "answer": "Subscription includes: 1) Cloud hosting and server management; 2) SSL certificate and CDN acceleration; 3) Daily automatic backups; 4) 7×24 technical support; 5) Security updates and bug fixes; 6) Feature optimization and performance improvements; 7) Depending on service type: payment gateway for e-commerce, app store publishing for apps, mini-program review submission, etc. You don't need to worry about any technical issues, just focus on business development."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel the subscription anytime?",
        "answer": "Yes. The subscription service uses a flexible subscription mechanism, you can cancel anytime, and we'll stop service after the current billing cycle ends. If you choose annual payment, enjoy 17% discount (equivalent to 10 months' price). After cancellation, we'll assist with data export and migration to ensure business continuity."
      },
      {
        "question": "What tech stack do you use?",
        "answer": "We use the most advanced tech stack in the industry. Frontend: React, Next.js, Vue, TypeScript; Backend: Node.js, Python, Go; Mobile: React Native, Flutter; Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis. We'll choose the most suitable technical solution based on project requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you ensure project quality?",
        "answer": "We have a strict quality assurance process: 1) Code review and standards; 2) Automated testing; 3) Performance optimization; 4) Security testing; 5) Multi-device compatibility testing; 6) User experience testing. Each stage has quality checkpoints to ensure high-quality product delivery."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I see development progress?",
        "answer": "Of course! We use agile development and regularly (usually weekly) show you development progress and results. You can view progress in real-time through project management tools, and we'll organize regular demo meetings to ensure the project progresses as expected."
      },
      {
        "question": "What payment methods are supported?",
        "answer": "We support multiple payment methods: bank transfer, Alipay, WeChat Pay, corporate transfer, etc. [One-time Purchase] payment is usually divided into: down payment (30-50%), mid-term payment (30-40%), final payment (20-30%). [Subscription] initial setup fee paid once, monthly/annual fees can be auto-deducted or transferred regularly. Specific payment methods can be negotiated based on project situation."
